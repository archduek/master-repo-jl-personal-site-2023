        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm James Loesch. This is my personal site. I write and publish my thoughts here. I also use this site as 
            a place to share what I'm working on and document my life.  
        </p>
        <p>I made this site by shamelessly copying 98% of the HTML and CSS from <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a>.
            It's okay, <a href="https://sive.rs/mirror">he actually encouraged me to do this.</a>
        </p>
        <p><strong>I'm a generalist</strong></p>
        <p>So much so that it's become my specialty. If there's one thing that comes easier to me than most people, it's learning more about a subject than anyone asked me too.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm from Long Island</strong></p>
        <p>Born and raised. The first 18 years of my life.</p>
        <p><strong>I respect anyone who has tried to make a healthy, equally tasty version of an unhealthy food</strong></p>
        <p>Because it's hard to do. But it's worth it.</p>
